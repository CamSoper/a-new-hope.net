This is a .NET Core port of [a fixture of Internet culture](http://www.asciimation.co.nz/index.php) that I remember from my college days in the late 90s.

## Thanks

Special thanks to original ASCIImation artist [Simon Jansen](mailto:asciimation@gmail.com), who granted me permission to use his original ASCII artwork in tech demos and samples.
